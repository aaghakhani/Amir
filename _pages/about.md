I am a tenure-track Professor in Biomedical Systems at University of Stuttgart, where I lead **Microrobotic Biomdedical Systems** group. Previously, I was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Mechanical Engineering at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk). Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://pi.is.mpg.de/), Department of Physical Intelligence in Stuttgart, Germany. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [Koc University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en), Turkey, in 2018. I got my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/) in 2012.

My research interests are centered on **small-scale medical robots**, **acoustics**, **ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging,** and **lab-on-a-chip systems**. In particular, my research thrusts focus on developing medical microrobots and microfluidic devices for biomedical applications by exploiting multiphysics computational modeling, advanced robot design and fabrication techniques, wireless actuation methods using acoustic and magnetic fields, microrobot tracking via ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, and minimally-invasive medical interventions.
