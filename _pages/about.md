The recent progress in micro/nanoscale fabrication technology has opened up new possibilities for the use of microrobots in various biomedical applications, such as targeted drug delivery, microsurgery, detoxification, and diagnostics. However, to realize their potential, medical microrobots must overcome obstacles like locomotion in complex biofluid media, wireless actuation, precise imaging and localization, and effective drug/cargo delivery in vivo. Our research group aims to provide solutions to these challenges by leveraging ultrasound technology for wireless actuation, imaging, and therapeutic functions in 3D vessels and tissues. Additionally, we will develop advanced lab-on-a-chip and microfluidics systems to emulate targeted drug delivery and microsurgery. To achieve these goals, our interdisciplinary Biomedical Systems research program will concentrate on the development of novel medical microrobots and ultrasound microfluidic and sensor devices. By bridging the gap between biomedical research and clinical applications, our work will propel medical microrobotics into the forefront of modern healthcare.

## About me

I am a tenure-track Professor in Biomedical Systems at the University of Stuttgart, where I lead the **Microrobotic Biomedical Systems** group. Previously, I was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Mechanical Engineering at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk). Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://pi.is.mpg.de/), Department of Physical Intelligence in Stuttgart, Germany. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [Koc University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en), Turkey, in 2018. I got my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/) in 2012.
