Our paper "[Real-time 3D optoacoustic tracking of cell-sized magnetic microrobots circulating in the mouse brain vasculature](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abm9132)" is published in Science Advances. We demonstrated real-time 3D optoacoustic tracking of magnetic microrobots (5-20 $$\mu$$m diamater) in circulatory vasculture of mice.
