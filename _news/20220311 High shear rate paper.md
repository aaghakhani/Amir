Our paper "[High shear rate propulsion of acoustic microrobots in complex biological fluids](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abm5126)‚Äù is published in Science Advances. Here, we show how acoustically-powered microrobots can be efficiently propelled thorough complex viscoelastic fluids, such as blood and mucus, by the use of high shear rate fluidic flow near their body.
